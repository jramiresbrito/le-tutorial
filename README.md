# Microposts App!

## This application aims to implement TDD technique while build a fullstack application following Ruby on Rails using Michael Hartl [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition).

## I'm also taking an opportunity to test the brand new [Bootstrap V5 Alpha](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/)


## My version in production can be found at: [https://le-tutorial.herokuapp.com/](https://le-tutorial.herokuapp.com/)
